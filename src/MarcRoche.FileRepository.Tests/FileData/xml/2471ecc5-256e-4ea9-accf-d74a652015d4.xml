      <p>A little about me and this blog... <img class="img-right" src="/images/2471ecc5-256e-4ea9-accf-d74a652015d4/me.jpg" /></p>
      <p>I am a Technical Software Architect with over 10 years of experience. My specialities include designing and developing enterprise messaging solutions and web applications.</p>
      <p>Over the last decade I have had the opportunity to gain experience in all phases of software development. This includes leading projects from concept and prototype development, through to documentation, estimation, and delivery.</p>
      <p>The majority of this time has been spent developing with C# and the .Net framework. Application domains have ranged from Telecommunication products, E-Commerce, application frameworks, and business support systems.</p> 
	  <p>Recently my interest has started shifting to dynamic languages and data science. This frequently leads to working with Javascript, Python, and Ruby. I expect the content on this blog to reflect that as well.</p>
      <p>The intent of this blog is to create a platform where I can share my experiences and explore new ideas. Hopefully it will open the door to new ideas and technologies for myself and others!</p>
      <p>Outside of software development, I enjoy chess, art, music, exercise, soccer, and spending time with my family.</p>
