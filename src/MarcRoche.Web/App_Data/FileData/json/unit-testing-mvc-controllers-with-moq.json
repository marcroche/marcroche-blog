In a well designed MVC application, the business logic is cleanly abstracted from the presentation by the controllers. This establishes a clean separation of concerns and allows the controllers to be tested for the simple act of requesting and receiving data.\r\n\r\nI will assume that most readers have already explored Test Driven Development to some extent. If you have not it is a key tenant behind modern software development and you should take a little time to research it.\r\n\r\nWhen setting up the tests for the web component of an MVC application, I am generally concerned with the controllers. What I am really wanting to test is that when a controller action is called it attempts to retrieve the data from a domain service. I am not concerned with the implemenation of the domain service at all during this stage. What I want to know is that when the controller invokes the domain service it responds with some data and the controller handles the data and passes it off to the view.\r\n\r\nMocking and Stubbing are two of the more popular approaches to establishing domain service contexts for the tests, and I use both techniques. But for the unit tests in this example I am using Mocking. This allows me to instantiate a domain service with a fake data context. This can be used to isolate the service to the facts that it can be instantiated and can return data, with no regards to the actual business logic that would usually be involved in the process.\r\n\r\n**Introducing Moq!**\r\n\r\nThere are many Mocking frameworks that available and I recommend playing with as many as possible. For this example I am using Moq. The source and binaries can be downloaded from the link or simply added to your project using Nuget.\r\n\r\nIn addition to Moq, I am using MSTest as my unit testing framework. Again, there are many testing frameworks and I encourage you to try out as many as you can.\r\n\r\nSo, let's see a simple test:\r\n\r\n```c#\r\n[TestMethod]\r\npublic void BlogControllerViewPostTest()\r\n{\r\n\t// Mock my data service\r\n\tMock<IBlogDataService> messagingService = new Mock<IBlogDataService>();\r\n\r\n\t// Setup the mock with some test implementation\r\n\tmessagingService.Setup(m => m.ViewPost(\"Closures in C#\")).Returns(() =>\r\n\t{\r\n\t\treturn new BlogPost { \r\n\t\t\tTitle = \"Testing with Moq in MVC\", \r\n\t\t\tAuthor = \"Test Author\", \r\n\t\t\tBody = \"Moq Rocks!\", \r\n\t\t\tPostDate = DateTime.Now \r\n\t\t};\r\n\t});\r\n\r\n\t// Create the controller and call an action\r\n\tBlogController controller = new BlogController(messagingService.Object);\r\n\tActionResult result = controller.ViewPost(\"Testing with Moq in MVC\");\r\n\tViewResult actual = (ViewResult)result;\r\n\r\n\t// Assert expectations\r\n\tAssert.AreEqual(\"Testing with Moq in MVC\", actual.Model.Title);\r\n}\r\n```\r\n\r\nAnd that's it! What we have done is created our service with a Mock implementation. Then we call the controller action and verify that the action is indeed passing the data on to the view.\r\n\r\nThe tests can become more involved, but I generally try to keep my controllers slim and push all of the logic back into the domain model.\r\n\r\nOne interesting note specific to Moq from the example above is that the Mock method is expecting the controller action to pass in \"Testing with Moq in MVC\". Any other value would not have went into Mock's implementation of ViewPost.","HtmlContent":"<h2>Unit Testing MVC Controllers with Moq</h2>\r\n\r\n<p><time class=\"postinfo left-50 postdate\">July 13, 2013</time></p>\r\n\r\n<p>One of the key advantages of using the MVC framework is its inhererent testability.
