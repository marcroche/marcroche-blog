<p>Now that we have taken a look at the basics of what promises are and how they work in <a href="/archive/2013/12/javascript-promises-1" target="_blank">Part 1</a>, let's have a look at one of the ways you are likely to work with them.</p>

<p>Probably the most common scenario where you will you use promises is during ajax calls. Some reasons for this are that we want to create responsive user interfaces that only load what data we need, and only when we need it. Or, maybe we want to completely load some set of data prior to continuing with other processing.</p>

<p>Using jQuery's ajax we can easily demonstrate both of these ideas.</p>
