<h2>JavaScript Promises: Looking at jQuery and Q</h2>

<p>Promises are a way of doing asynchronous programming in javascript. Prior to promises the most common technique was to have callbacks. Although callbacks worked fine, they were incredibly tough to follow and difficult to maintain.</p>

<p>JavaScript promises are formally defined by <a href="http://wiki.commonjs.org/wiki/Promises" target="_blank">CommonJS</a>. There are many implementations that have been developed, but two that will serve you best in both client and server development are jQuery and Q implementations.</p>
