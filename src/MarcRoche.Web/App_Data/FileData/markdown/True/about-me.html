<p>A little about me and this blog... <img class="img-right" src="/artifacts/about-me/me.jpg" /></p>

<p>I am a Technical Software Architect and Lead Software Developer with over 10 years of experience. My specialities include designing and developing enterprise messaging solutions and web applications.</p>

<p>Over the last decade I have had the opportunity to gain experience in all phases of software development. This includes leading projects from concept and prototype development, through to documentation, estimation, and delivery.</p>

<p>The majority of this time has been spent developing with C# and the .Net framework. Application domains have ranged from Telecommunication products, E-Commerce, application frameworks, and business support systems.</p>

<p>Recently my interest has started shifting to dynamic and functional languages. I find myself frequently working with Javascript, Python, and Ruby (with an empahsis on server side and client side Javascript). I also expect the topics I blog about to reflect this as well.</p>

<p>The intent of this blog is to create a platform where I can share my experiences and explore new ideas. Hopefully it will open the door to new ideas and technologies for myself and others!</p>

<p>Outside of software development, I enjoy chess, art, music, exercise, soccer, and family.</p>
